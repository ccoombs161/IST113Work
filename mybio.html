        <p>Hello, my name is Cameron. I am currently a student at NHTI. 
            This is a bio for my web programming class. The web page isn't
            nearly as advanced as facebook or other professional websites. 
            Although it is basic at the moment I hope eventually I can make 
            it better. In the sidebar you will find some links to
            useful sights.
        </p>

        <p> When I'm not working on schoolwork I enjoy working on cars. I enjoy working on 4X4'S the most. 
             I plan on modifying my new jeep soon. I think the best part about working on 4X4's is taking them 
             offroad after you work on them.
